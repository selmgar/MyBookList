# Title - MyBookList
## Description - The motivation behind this project was to create a simple application utilizing html, css, and javascript.  We wanted to create an interactive tracker that focuses on books. It allows a user to track books they want to read, are currently reading, have read, and do not want to finish reading. The ablity to track a users personal reading experience was solved. In this project we learned how to utilize bootstrap and create interactive aspects on the site.
